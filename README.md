Hi, I'm EUP

I'm an 18 year old Nigerian Android developer passionate about building apps that make a difference. I'm always looking for new ways to learn and grow.

I'm currently working on Enotes,Westudio and some personal projects, and I'm excited to share my work with the world. I'm also always looking for new opportunities to collaborate with others.
